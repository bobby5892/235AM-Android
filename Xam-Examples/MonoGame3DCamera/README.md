MonoGame Project with 3D Camera and Model Positioning and Orientation
====================================

This project extends the Model with Vertex-based drawing project to add a user-controlled camera and 3D Model movement/orientation.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for Android and one cross-platform portable class library. It is the result of the 3D Coordinates and Camera project.
