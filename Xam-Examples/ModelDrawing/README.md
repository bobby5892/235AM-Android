MonoGame Model Drawing Project for Android
====================================

This project shows how to load a XNB file into a MonoGame Model instance. Once loaded the Model instance is drawn on-screen six times. It is the result of working through the MonoGame Model walkthrough.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for Android and one cross-platform portable class library.
